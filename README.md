# River Sediment Data Analysis

## About the data
The US Forest Service collects waterway samples and measures them for sediment concentration.  Changes to sediment concentration (or sediment load) can have multiple potential causes, for instance, seasonal changes, local precipitation, long-term climate change, nearby logging operations, nearby construction or other activities that cause soil erosion near waterways.

The data used in this analysis was collected by Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest personnel in northern Idaho, and stored, with sediment load calculations, in Excel. It contains more than three decades of sediment data for a single waterway location.

## What's in this repository
Individual notebooks at the main level of this repository are clearly named with each stage of data analysis. This is currently a work in progress, additional data analysis to come.  

The `Composite Notebook` folder contains a single notebook duplicating most of the code in the individual notebooks, for anyone who would prefer to review the whole process in a single notebook.
